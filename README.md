# Encrypted File Transfer

This Python script demonstrates how to encrypt files found in a specified directory and send the encryption key to a server via HTTP. The encryption is done using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme provided by the `cryptography` library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library (install via `pip install cryptography`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Modify the server URL in the `send_text_to_server` function to match your server address.
3. Run the script.
4. The script will generate a key, encrypt the contents of all files found in the user's "Pictures" directory, and send the encryption key to the server.
5. Encrypted files will be created in the same directory with the original file names.

## Warning

- **Security Risks**: Sending encryption keys over HTTP is insecure. Use HTTPS to protect the key during transmission.
- **Overwriting Files**: The script overwrites original files with encrypted content. Ensure you have backups or implement a way to restore the original files.
- **Key Management**: The encryption key is not stored securely within the script. Ensure the key is stored safely if it needs to be reused for decryption.
- **File Type Checking**: The current script does not filter for specific file types. Uncomment and adjust the file type checking section as needed.
